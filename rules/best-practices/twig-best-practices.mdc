# Twig Template Best Practices
- Use Drupal's Twig debugging to identify template suggestions.
- Keep logic minimal in templates; use preprocess functions for data manipulation.
- Use BEM naming conventions for CSS classes.
- Reference component templates from [components/](components/) when possible.
