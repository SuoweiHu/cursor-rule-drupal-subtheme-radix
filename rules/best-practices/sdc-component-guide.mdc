# Single-Component-Directory Component Guide
##  Single-Component-Directory's Component Directory Sturcture
Each component directory typically contains: (assuming the component name is sdc-component-name)
- A compulsory `sdc-component-name.component.yml` file for component metadata, it is requried for the directory to be identified as a SDC by Drupal
- A compulsory `sdc-component-name.twig` file for the template, it is required for the directory to be identified as a SDC by Drupal
- Optional `sdc-component-name.scss`, which will be compiled into `sdc-component-name.css` and `sdc-component-name.css.map` by laravel mix
- Optional `_sdc-component-name.js`, which will be compiled into `sdc-component-name.js` by laravel mix
- Optional `README.mdx` file, revealing the "Key Features", "Custom Options", "Template Structure" and "Usage" of the theme.
- Follow naming conventions: `[sdc-component-name]-opc` for OPC-specific components (that is all the newly created components).

## Best Practices
- When you are updating the SDC component, please remember to update its `.component.yml`, `README.mdx` along its `.twig`, `.js`, `.scss` files to reflect the changes. For instance when you are removing a prop or slot from the `.twig` file, please besure to update them in the `.component.yml` file to indicate the prop or slot is no longer there, and reflect this change in the description and examples in the `README.mdx` file.
